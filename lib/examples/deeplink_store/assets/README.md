Place deeplink store product images in this folder.

Expected naming:
- Base images: `lib/examples/deeplink_store/assets/products/<id>-0.jpg`
- High-resolution variants: `lib/examples/deeplink_store/assets/products/2.0x/<id>-0.jpg`

The `<id>` should match the product id from `ProductsRepository` (0-37 by default).
